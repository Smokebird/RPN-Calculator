What do we need? 

stack class-> stack.h stack.cpp 

operand buttons-> operandbutton.h operandButton.cpp

operator button, binay and unary. *.h *.cpp (inherit from these)

operand

display box (fltk box)

need to work with floating point numbers. 



32-   = 3 - 2 



John Doorenbos -> 641 - 888 -0162
Emily Platts -> 651 - 380 - 1044    01
Cuyler Vander Werker -> 218 - 251 -5315  02 


right now when you press a numberbutton, it puts it right on the stack, now allowing for two digit numbers. so, I think that a static char* should be added to the operandButton, and then when you click on the number, it will add the number character to the statjic char star. A press of an enter button would allow you to access the static variable and then add it to the stack.  

So here is the deal. My current plan of having a float vector to hold the numbers before enter is pressed is not going to work. It doesn't handle decimals.
